# Snow Link
Snow link is a full-stack CRUD app for the ski & snowboard community. Users are able to create an account, make a profile, and browse events and other users that are in their radius.

## MVP 
- Frontend: Simple UI that allows users to navigate, create, view, and manage events, and also create and update their profile using authentication.

- Backend: Node.js server built with Express that handles user requests, and manages data.

- Database: MongoDB collection that stores event data, user data, and authentication information.

- Geolocation: Enable the app to provide events in the user's area using a geolocation API.
